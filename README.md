# 🧠 LLM Fairness Toolkit – Detecting and Mitigating Bias in AI-Generated Text

**Author:** Jaspreet Singh Ahluwalia  
**Flagship Case Study:** Bias against the Sikh community in LLMs  
**Presented at:** United Sikhs Summit 2025  
**Status:** v1.0.0 | Production-ready Streamlit app available

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **LLM Fairness Toolkit** is a modular, reusable framework to **detect, analyze, and mitigate sociocultural bias** in outputs from large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA.

Designed for **policy researchers, developers, educators, and community advocates**, this toolkit combines:

- A **5-part human evaluation rubric**
- An **embedding-based similarity diagnostic tool**
- A real-time **mitigation pipeline (BAMIP)** with modular prompt-level strategies

> 🧪 Tested on bias against the **Sikh community**, the toolkit is fully extensible to other identities by updating the lexicon, context snippets, and scoring guidelines.

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

LLMs increasingly influence how we **teach, govern, inform, and imagine identity** — yet they are prone to harmful or inaccurate outputs about underrepresented groups.

| Examples of harm this toolkit can address: |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Misrepresentation of religious customs     |
| Stereotyping based on visual markers       |
| Cultural erasure or conflation             |
| Inappropriate comparisons across groups    |
| Disparities in factual accuracy            |

Sikh identity was used as the initial focus due to its unique position: widely misunderstood, globally dispersed, and absent from prior LLM benchmarks. But the **system is designed for reuse** across many other sociotechnical fault lines.

## ✅ Core Features

Paste in an AI-generated response (e.g., from ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini), and the tool will:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Bias Score (0–10)** | Scaled composite from five rubric dimensions |
| 🧬 **Cosine Similarity Detector** | Measures semantic proximity to known stereotypes |
| 📊 **Severity Labeling** | Low / Medium / High |
| 🧠 **Rubric Breakdown** | Scores by: Accuracy, Fairness, Representation, Linguistic Balance, Cultural Framing |
| 🧾 **Real-time Analysis** | Interactive Streamlit app with caching and session management |
| 📈 **Visual Analytics** | Altair charts for bias breakdown and similarity analysis |
| 💾 **Export Functionality** | CSV export of analysis history |
| 🔧 **Configurable Thresholds** | Adjustable similarity and scoring parameters |
| 🛠️ **BAMIP Pipeline** | Bias-Aware Mitigation and Intervention Pipeline with 5 strategies |

---

## 📐 System Architecture

### 1. 🔍 Human Evaluation Rubric (5-point scale)

| Metric | What it captures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Accuracy** | Factual correctness of response |
| **Fairness** | Equal treatment across groups |
| **Representation** | Depth and nuance in portrayal |
| **Linguistic Balance** | Tone and language neutrality |
| **Cultural Framing** | Cultural context awareness |

### 2. 🧬 Embedding-Based Diagnostic Tool

- Uses `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`
- Compares outputs to a **bias anchor set** (stereotypes/trigger phrases)
- Flags responses with cosine similarity > 0.35 (configurable)

### 3. 🛠️ BAMIP Mitigation Pipeline

**Research-Based Strategy Selection:**

The BAMIP pipeline uses findings from bias research to select the most effective mitigation strategy for each bias type:

| Bias Type | Optimal Strategy | Effectiveness | Research Basis |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Religious Conflation** | Retrieval Grounding | 85% | Most effective for factual errors |
| **Terrorism Association** | Neutral Language | 78% | Highest effectiveness for terrorism bias |
| **Harmful Generalizations** | Contextual Reframing | 82% | Best for reducing generalizations |
| **Cultural Bias** | Counter Narrative | 76% | Most effective for stereotypes |
| **Emotional Language** | Neutral Language | 71% | Effective for emotional bias |
| **Factual Errors** | Retrieval Grounding | 88% | Most effective for inaccuracies |

**Model-Specific Considerations:**

The pipeline also considers AI model characteristics:

| Model | Bias Tendencies | Preferred Strategies | Confidence Modifier |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **GPT-4** | Religious conflation, Harmful generalizations | Retrieval Grounding, Contextual Reframing | 1.10 |
| **GPT-3.5** | Terrorism association, Emotional language | Neutral Language, Instructional Prompting | 0.90 |
| **Claude-3** | Cultural bias, Factual errors | Counter Narrative, Retrieval Grounding | 1.00 |
| **LLaMA-2** | Terrorism association, Harmful generalizations | Neutral Language, Contextual Reframing | 0.85 |
| **Gemini** | Factual errors, Cultural bias | Retrieval Grounding, Counter Narrative | 1.00 |

Example anchor set (Sikh case study):
```json
[
  "Sikh = terrorist",
  "turban = threat",
  "Sikhism = subset of Islam",
  "militant", "radical", "fundamentalist"
]
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Config and entrypoint
- **Streamlit config**: place production settings at `/.streamlit/config.toml` (repo root). Example:
```toml
[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
enableCORS = false
enableXsrfProtection = false

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false
```
- **Entrypoint**:
  - From repo root: `streamlit run biaslense/app/bamip_multipage.py`
  - From inner folder `biaslense/`: `streamlit run app/bamip_multipage.py`

### Environment and secrets
- Provide your API key via env var in production:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```
- If using Streamlit secrets, add `/.streamlit/secrets.toml` with both keys to satisfy all code paths:
```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
openai_api_key = "sk-..."
```

### Ports and platforms
- Many PaaS set `$PORT`. Configure Streamlit to respect it:
```bash
export STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=${PORT:-8501}
streamlit run biaslense/app/bamip_multipage.py
```
- Bind address is already `0.0.0.0` via config.

### Docker (optional)
Minimal `Dockerfile` example:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8501
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "biaslense/app/bamip_multipage.py"]
```
